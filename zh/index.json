這兒會有嗎? 我可以預先告訴大家這答案是否定的。\n這不是因為害怕版權問題而要隱藏, 我們可是很正經的只做試題標籤化(Tagging)和瀏覽工具(browser), 從不分發(Distribute)試題PDF檔案。\n其原因之一是參與者尚未讀大學, 未選行業；不論對我們的讚許與批判都是過早的影響。 這個網站的確和其他只上載PDF檔的 DSELIFE 後繼者有點不同, 但有技術在手也不等於必然只在網絡科技上發展, 大學讀些自學難學到的科目更有意義, 懂法律的科技專家或懂科技的法律專家也很有趣。\n更直接的原因是顏回說過: 「願無伐善, 無施勞」。「無伐善」, 就是做好事, 不說出來, 大家温習方便了, 有進步就好。不必深究誰做到, 才合乎我們的初心。\n還有一個原因就是讓這温習工具保持中立持平。一旦有了創辦者的身份, 人們就會去問成長的經歷, 深追這「善」是儒道墨法哪家的「善」。百家爭鳴已過兩千多年, 香港更中西文化交融之地。 與其標上了某思想的「品牌」出現「這是乙家的作品, 我們甲家不想使用」之類的抗拒反應, 不如把一切都歸於文化之中。 不管大家從哪一種信仰學習了「善」, 只要把「善」化作行動, 以記錄下的行為型成文化, 那大家都可以共融在相同的文化中了。 只要世人都記得, 中國文化就是「知書識禮」(儒)、「為而不爭」(道)、「兼愛無我」(墨)、「奉公守法」(法); 各家都已深入文化之中, 對人類的文明作出了貢獻, 又何需增其長短呢? 在香港, 你差不多可以遇上所有宗教的信徒, 不談飲食和教義, 只問怎樣待人才正確的話, 他們的答案又有何差異呢? 如果人類最終能把人間的「善」都活成「地球文化」, 世間又怎會有宗教衝突呢?\n"},{"uri":"https://pastpaper.xyz/zh/tags/%E4%BB%BB%E4%BD%95%E4%BA%BA/","title":"任何人","tags":[],"description":"","content":""},{"uri":"https://pastpaper.xyz/zh/blog/2025-08-05/","title":"0

是因為只要社企須要正常地生存, 就不會以便宜的價格衝擊市場嗎? 還是因為只要人想賺更多, 就會在前期投入預算上花費更多, 令市場更活躍?\n找個方法令服務可以永遠持續, 我當然認同, 但這不一定是以高收入來達到收支平衡。 反之, 零支出的收支平衡更易達到啊! 以本站的建站過程來分析:\n域名2個, 約800元 域名年費, 約120元, pastpaper.x 永久免年費; pastpaper.xyz 是過渡性的傳統域名, 免不了年費 伺服器算力支出, 0元 網頁寄存費, 0元 電費, 0元 工資, 自己做, 0元 推廣, 只有人讚好和S.E.O., 0元 只要再解決域名的支出, 就真的可以做到 0 開支的建站鏈了。\n這免費建站的方式, 不只可用在慈善服務上, 也可給各界有意在網上創業的人參考, 甚至幫助現有企業節省成本。 不論您的項目有沒有收入, 0成本就意味您在定價上有 更廣寬的空間。 我剛剛就在今早的新聞中讀到, 某本港超市也降低採購成本, 希望 減價吸引消費者。\n多了這種低成本的空間, 有點子的人就不用怕風險, 社區的創意就能更有效的發揮, 大家作為使用者也可以享用更多服務了。如果同學們有留心, 老師上課時、考試時用的網頁計時器, 明明不是什麼難造的東西； 香港人就是只看FoodPanda那類高收入IT企業, 忘了這類看似沒收入, 但很多人受惠的小工具。 論收入, 網頁計時器是否蚊型項目我不知道, 但論受惠者數量卻遍及大部份現在或曾經是學生的人。\n至於 0 開支的建站鏈會否衝擊傳統域名註冊商和數據中心的業務? 我只能說:\u0026ldquo;這是技術革命, 就像過去的 工業革命一樣。\u0026rdquo; 世界朝向令多數人受惠的方向前進, 這是大眾渴望世界前進所支持的潮流, 是沒法停下的。 聰明的數據中心可以在提昇穩定性等方面添加增值服務, 而不是向客戶硬銷過時的服務。\n後記: 講開就唔想停手, 加入了一個倒計時器, 是由Pomodoro timer開啟發, 參考德文的計時器介面重寫的； 你可以加在開始工作前，在工作清單輪入幾項功課 / 要温習的課目, 自由設定單項工作的時長和之間的小休時長，比一般Pomodoro timer靈活。\n工作自動案重要性 -10~+10 排列, 每一節後會自動移除一項。 會放到已完成的工作區域, 方便按重置重新使用(要改重要性可以copy\u0026amp;paste重新加入) 。\n我們不怕温習, 但不知終點會有點灰(或者終點以月計算太遠) 就會有點灰； 每次幾十分鐘, 就可以看到希望啦!\nLet\u0026rsquo;s Begin~\n轉送點在左欄
